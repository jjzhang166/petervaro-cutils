ABOUT
=====

cutils (C Utilities) is a collection of simple, modern and truly powerful tools
to make one's life a little easier when programming in C. The utilities were
created mostly to fulfill the personal needs of the author, however he hopes and
believes many will find the tools just as useful and essential as he does.

CONTRIBUTOR'S NOTE
==================

cutils uses very strict naming conventions, so, if you want to contribute to it,
you have to follow these rules. In my personal experience, the conventions
described below truly makes the code cleanewr, easier to read, to understand, to
modify later on and make it maintainable on the long run.


Public variable and function/method names:

    all_lowercase_letters_separated_by_underscores

    eg.:

        /* inline variable name */
        bool error_flag = false;

        /* method name of object in global namespace */
        cutils_cdar_DynamicArray_void_ptr_new()
          ^       ^          ^             ^
          |       |          |             |
        project  module    object        method
         name     name      name          name


Private variable and function/method names:

    _all_lowercase_letters_separated_by_underscores_started_with_underscore

    eg.: int _counter;


Constants (macros enums):

    FULL_UPPERCASE_LETTERS_SEPARATED_BY_UNDERSCORE

    eg.:

        /* inline and public constants */
        #define CUTILS_NAMESPACE

        /* guard macro variables */
        _C_APPLICATION_PROGRAMMING_INTERFACE_H_27277619327951796_
        ^                   ^                ^        ^         ^
        |                   |                |        |         |
       leading          full name        extension  random   trailing
      underscore      of the module                 number  underscore


Labels:

    Words_Started_With_Capital_Letters_Separated_By_Underscore

    eg.: goto Error_Window_Initialisation_Failed;


Objects:

    WordsStartedWithCapitalLettersAndNotSeparated

    eg.: typedef struct {} MyObject;

        DynamicArray_unsigned_long_long
             ^               ^
             |               |
         base type        related
                        standard type
