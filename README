cutils
======

cutils is a set of very simple tools to make one's life a little easier while
one is programming in C. I created it mostly for personal usage and needs, but I
believe many will find it as useful as I do.

The following tools are included:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
cenv.py

    Sets up a minimal C environment.
    Very practical to test ideas quicly, or to start a project from sketch.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
cref.c

    Reference of the Standard C Library.
    It has two purposes:
    1) To be a quick reference guide, with short explanations
    2) To use it in a text editor to extend the auto complition's functionality
    THIS FILE IS NOT A VALID C FILE!
