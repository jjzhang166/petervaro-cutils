- name: Python 3
  info: |
        This module is written in `Python 3`, therefore it needs the interpreter
        to be installed on your system to run it. I suggest you to use a
        package-manager to keep your installations ordered, clean and upto-date.

  examples:
    CALL: ''
  '':
    - - '**Macintosh:** one can use [homebrew](http://brew.sh/)'
      - \\OFFbrew install python3

    - - '**Windows:** one can use [chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/)'
      - \\OFFcinst python3

    - - '**Linux:** on Ubuntu and LinuxMint it is already installed'
      - \\OFFsudo apt-get install python3
