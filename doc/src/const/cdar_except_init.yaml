  Function cannot operate on `NULL` pointer. Note: this exception only
  occurs when the passed pointer is pointing to `NULL`, otherwise if the
  pointer is pointing to some memory garbage it will be considered as a
  perfectly legal argument. (However in that case probably a
  `SEGMENTATION FAULT` error will be generated.)
