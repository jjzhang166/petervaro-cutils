      It is an optional but highly recommended dependency. Under the hood
      `VAR_module` is hashing the files, to detect if a file has been changed or
      not. Because `pyhashxx` is the fastest hashing algorithm, it will speed up
      the checking process. By default the fallback mechanism is `SHA1` hashing
      which is way slower.

examples:
  CALL: ''
'':
  - - '`pyhashxx` is available to install through `pip`'
    - \\OFFpip3 install pyhashxx
