              `cutils` *(C Utilities)* is a collection of simple, modern and
              truly powerful tools to make one's life a little easier when
              programming in C. The utilities were created mostly to fulfill the
              personal needs of the author, however he hopes and believes many
              will find the tools just as useful and essential as he does.
